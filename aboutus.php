<div class="about">
        <p>In these days almost every college has various clubs for students maintained by students in college.
         It includes various technical ,non-technical clubs, sports club and branch associations. Every year many students join the clubs as well as leave as they pass out from college.
Somewhere there is a need to maintain the database for all the students joining the club ,
participating in various activities organised by particular club and data of core members of clubs. 
This website is solution to the all the problems.
Trefle can be used by students to manage their club in efficient way.<br>
The site TREFLE was designed with an idea to have smooth communication between the student and the clubs.
 In the fast-paced world students literally need a website to publicize their club and club activities in an
  organised manner.
